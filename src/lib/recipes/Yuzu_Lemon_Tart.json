Be careful not to cook on high heat or it will curdle. Add in either the bloomed gelatin sheet or thickened powdered gelatin, and whisk to cook until fully dissolved.",

				"While the egg whites are mixing, combine ['ing']{Granulated sugar} and ['ing']{Water} in a saucepan over medium heat and heat on medium low until it reaches ['temp']{121}. Lower the stand mixer speed to low to avoid the hot sugar from splattering up, and slowly pour the boiling sugar syrup into the bowl of whisking egg whites.",

				"Spoon into a piping bag fitted with a round nozzle, and decorate your chill tarts. Use a blow torch to crisp the edges of the meringue topping."
