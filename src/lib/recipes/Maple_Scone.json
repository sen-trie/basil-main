				"Add the ['ing']{Heavy cream} and ['ing']{Maple syrup} and stir until just combined. You will have a shaggy, wet dough.",
				"Place a piece of parchment the size of your baking sheet on the counter. To keep it from moving, add a few drops of water on top of counter and then place parchment on top. This sticks it to the counter.",
				"Sprinkle parchment with about <u>['fac']{35}g quick oats</u>. Turn out dough onto oats. Sprinkle top of dough with some more oats. The oats will make the dough less sticky and easier to form. Pat down the dough into approximately a 1\" thick round.",
				"Cut into 8 wedges using a scraper or knife, and slightly separate as you slice. Don't cut through the parchment. Pick up the parchment by the edges and transfer onto a baking sheet.",
				"Bake for 20-25 minutes. Cool on wire rack before icing."
