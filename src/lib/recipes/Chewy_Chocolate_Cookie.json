			"steps": [
				"In a large bowl, whisk the ['ing']{All-purpose flour}, ['ing']{Baking soda}, ['ing']{Cornstarch}, and ['ing']{Salt} together. Set aside.",
				"In a medium bowl, whisk the ['ing']{Unsalted butter}, ['ing']{Light or dark brown sugar}, and ['ing']{Granulated sugar} together until no lumps remain.",
				"Whisk in the ['ing']{Large egg} and ['ing']{Egg yolk} until combined, then whisk in the ['ing']{Pure vanilla extract}. The mixture will be thin.",
				"Pour into dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or spatula. The dough will be very soft, thick, and shiny. <strong>Do not overmix.</strong>",
				"Fold in the ['ing']{Semi-sweet chocolate chips}. The chocolate chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them.",
				"Cover the dough tightly and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.",
				"Preheat oven to ['temp']{163}. Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. If the dough has chilled for longer than 2 hours, let it sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes.",
				"Using a cookie scoop or measuring spoon, scoop 1/4 cup of the chilled cookie dough. Roll into a ball, then use your fingers to shape the cookie dough so that it's taller rather than wide—almost like a cylinder. Arrange the cookies 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.",
				"Bake the cookies for 14-16 min or until the edges are very lightly browned. The centers will look very soft, but the cookies will continue to set as they cool.",
				"Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely. While the cookies are still warm, press a few more chocolate chips into the tops—this is optional and only for looks!",
				"Store tightly covered at room temperature for up to 1 week."
