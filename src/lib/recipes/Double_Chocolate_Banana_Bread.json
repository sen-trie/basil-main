				"In a mixing bowl, whisk the ['ing']{All-purpose flour}, ['ing']{Cocoa powder}, ['ing']{Baking soda}, and ['ing']{Salt} together until combined. Mix in ['ing']{Semi-sweet chocolate chips}. Set aside.",
				"Using a handheld mixer, beat the ['ing']{Unsalted butter} and ['ing']{Granulated sugar} together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. With the mixer running on medium speed, add the ['ing']{Large eggs} one at a time, beating well after each addition.",
				" Then beat in the ['ing']{Sour cream}, ['ing']{Mashed bananas}, and ['ing']{Vanilla extract} until combined. Add the dry ingredients and ['ing']{Hot water}, and beat on low speed until combined. Batter is thick <strong>(Do not overmix)</strong>.",
				"Pour and spread the batter into the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle remaining chocolate chips on top, down the center of the loaf.",
				"Bake for 60-65 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent the top from drying out. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with only a few small moist crumbs.",
				"Remove the bread from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan set on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before removing."
